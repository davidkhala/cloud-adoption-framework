## Themes (realms)
- Learn
- Lead
  - The extent to which IT teams are supported by a mandate from leadership to 
migrate to cloud, and the degree to which the teams themselves are cross-functional, 
collaborative, and self-motivated.
- Scale
- Secure

## 3 Phases
In each phase, you will likely implement some degree of change to your IT teams (people), your applications and software tools (technology), and your operating model (process)

### Tactical phase
- Individual workloads are in place
- Quick wins
- It should not be undervalued. There is also great value in the lessons learned through experimentation, beyond benefits from lower TCO outcome

Focus: **optimizing cost**
- Reducing the cost of discrete systems. 
- getting to the cloud with minimal disruption on IT teams(People), your applications and software tools (technology) and operating model (process)

Boundary
- no coherent plan encompassing all of workloads with a strategy for building out to the future.
- no provision for scale. 
- Be cautious if your business does not already have firsthand experience running production use cases in the cloud today


### Strategic phase
- A broader vision governs individual workloads
- begin to embrace change

Focus: **increasing value**
- IT teams are increasing the value of harnessing the cloud for your business operations
- designed and developed with an eye to future needs and scale

### Transformational phase
- cloud operations functioning smoothly
- Your people and processes are being transformed
- Existing data is transparently shared. New data is collected and analyzed.
- The predictive and prescriptive analytics of machine learning applied.

Focus
- integrating the data and insights garnered from working now in the cloud
- Transform IT from a cost center to a partner to the business.

# Assess
- Work with a Technical Account Manager (TAM) to perform a high-level assessment of your organization’s cloud maturity, streamlines your cloud adoption journey
- The assesement will prioritize your training and change management programs, your partner relationships, your cloud operating model, and your secure account configuration.

# Goal: Ask yourself how far you want to go
Discuss within your team which stage of cloud maturity your business should aim for.
- Challenge: stakeholders across different levels of your IT organization will not be aligned and that they’ll point out that the incentives vs. risks don’t yet match their aspirations.
- Solution: Consider focusing on tactical objectives in the near term to serve as a stepping stone for later strategic or long-term transformational objectives.
