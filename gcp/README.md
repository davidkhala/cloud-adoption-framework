# Executive Summary
The Google Cloud Adoption Framework builds a structure on the rubric of people, process, and technology that you can work with, providing a solid assessment of where you are in your journey to the cloud and actionable programs that get you to where you want to be. 

You can use the framework yourself to make an assessment of your organization's readiness for the cloud

# Assess
- Work with a Technical Account Manager (TAM) to perform a high-level assessment of your organization’s cloud maturity, streamlines your cloud adoption journey
- The assesement will prioritize your training and change management programs, your partner relationships, your cloud operating model, and your secure account configuration.

# Goal: Ask yourself how far you want to go
Discuss within your team which stage of cloud maturity your business should aim for.
- Challenge: stakeholders across different levels of your IT organization will not be aligned and that they’ll point out that the incentives vs. risks don’t yet match their aspirations.
- Solution: Consider focusing on tactical objectives in the near term to serve as a stepping stone for later strategic or long-term transformational objectives.

# Plan: your cloud adoption program
Take action on any cloud adoption epic. Keep in mind that your actions are a means to one of four ends
- developing a training program
- devising your change management program
- designing your cloud operating model
- securely setting up your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
