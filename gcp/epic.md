# Fine-tuning your direction with epics
Once you’ve determined where you are in your cloud maturity journey, it’s time to move forward.
To scope and structure your program of cloud adoption, you will implement a number of workstreams.

Here’s a look at those epics within the familiar rubric of people, technology, and process.

If you can do only a subset of the epics, focus on the ones in the colored segments. Those are the epics that align with Learn, Lead, Scale, and Secure


# Workstreams (Epics)
- Epics are defined without overlap
- Aligned to manageable groups of stakeholders
- Broken down into individual User Stories, making your program planning easier.
